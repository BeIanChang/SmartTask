# Contributing

## Project Principles
- Keep the app minimal, fast to log, and local-only.
- Avoid extra dependencies unless explicitly approved.
- Prefer SwiftUI + SwiftData for app features.

## Workflow
- Keep changes small and focused on a single task.
- Follow existing naming and formatting conventions.
- Avoid inline comments unless explicitly requested.

## Local Development
1. Open the project in Xcode.
2. Build and run on a simulator or device.

## Pull Requests
- Summarize changes clearly.
- Include any relevant notes for testing or verification.
